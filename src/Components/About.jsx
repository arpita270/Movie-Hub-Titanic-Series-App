              The 1997 movie Titanic, directed by James Cameron, is a fictionalized account of the 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic, focusing on a love story between a young, upper-class woman, Rose, and a poor artist, Jack, during the ship's maiden voyage. The film interweaves historical events with a fictional narrative, exploring themes of class, love, and survival against the backdrop of the disaster.

              The Titanic was considered unsinkable at the time of its maiden voyage, but the disaster demonstrated the dangers of overconfidence and the importance of being prepared for the worst-case scenario. This lesson is essential for the maritime industry and any organisation dealing with complex systems and potential risks.
